**Stellary:** A sensory-based mapping practice for how we perceive and remember. It's a poetic, tactile, and deeply personal method of reflection.

#### **Core Idea:**

Imagine an "inner emotional galaxy." Each constellation begins with a felt sense or insight — a "star" of awareness — around which fragments of experience orbit: photographs, textures, snippets of conversation, ambient sounds, written lines, voice notes, or found objects. This method honors resonance over sequence and meaning over structure.

#### **Purpose:**

  * To pause and reflect.
  * To archive moments of deep emotional texture.
  * To make sense of a transition, loss, or breakthrough.
  * For "feeling before knowing."
  * It’s about presence, not productivity.

#### **Structure of a Stellary:**

  * **CORE:** The central emotion, moment, or insight. Mark an image as a "Core Star" using the ⭐ button.
  * **SENSORY OBJECTS:** Visual (🖼️), auditory (🎵), video (🎞️), written fragments (🔤), or Scent Evocations (💦) orbiting the core.
  * **END NODE:** A reflective close or destination. Mark an image as an "End Node" using the 🏁 button.

\<p\>\<strong\>Arrangement:\</strong\> Layout is meaning. A \<strong\>Radial Guide\</strong\> (🎯) can be toggled for a Core Star to assist with spatial arrangement.\</p\>

*"This is not a map to follow. It's a map to remember with."*
